# TYPESCRIPT - SOLID
Learning Challenge

## Must do!
Try to make more time for the theoretical part here. Try to understand, research, document.

- [x] Before installing, read the article: [Typescript for JavaScript programmers](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
- [x] Start with the installation
  - For Mac users that have node.js installed globally:
  - [x] Install Typescript 
    - `npm install typescript --save-dev -g`
  - [x] PhpStorm integration:
  - Here I went for the first option, make it so all TypeScript files are compiled the moment you change something in the file. `File | Settings | Languages & Frameworks | Typescript` and make sure to check -[x] Recompile on changes
  - [x] Install Parcel (make sure you have node.js installed)
    - `npm install parcel --save-dev -g`
    - After installing parcel you should be able to run `parcel index.html` in your project directory.
- [x] Try and make a 'Hello TypeScript'
  - resource: [Hello World](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hello-world-in-typescript-language/)
